# Lynz-Backend

Lynz is a web app aimed to display the busyness of nearby stores based on live data from the users. This will help users to make informative decisions about when to leave their house to go to the store. This was made in an effort to help stop the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
The backend code was made with node.js along with express. As well, MongoDB and mongoose were tools we used for our database.
